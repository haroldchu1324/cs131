3. Write the command you would use to find all the processes owned by you. Paste the output of the same. 
ps -u haroldf23
Output:
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 729706 ?        00:00:00 systemd
 729708 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
 729714 ?        00:00:00 sshd
 729717 pts/62   00:00:00 bash
 737018 pts/62   00:00:00 ps

4.b. In the second terminal use the same command you used in Q3 and paste the output of it below. What did you notice? What is the Process ID for the vim?

    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 729706 ?        00:00:00 systemd
 729708 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
 729714 ?        00:00:00 sshd
 729717 pts/62   00:00:00 bash
 737553 ?        00:00:00 sshd
 737554 pts/77   00:00:00 bash
 737942 pts/62   00:00:00 vim
 738086 pts/77   00:00:00 ps
 
I noticed that the processes are updated and can be accessed from different terminals. The proccess ID for vim is 737942


d. In the second terminal use the same command you used in Q3 and paste the output of it below. what did you notice? What changed and why?

    PID TTY          TIME CMD
 729706 ?        00:00:00 systemd
 729708 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
 729714 ?        00:00:00 sshd
 729717 pts/62   00:00:00 bash
 737553 ?        00:00:00 sshd
 737554 pts/77   00:00:00 bash
 738818 pts/77   00:00:00 ps

I noticed that the vim is gone from the list of processes even when checked from a 2nd terminal. the Process ID for vim is gone.
